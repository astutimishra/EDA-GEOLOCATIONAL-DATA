# EDA-GEOLOCATIONAL-DATA

This project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best accommodation for students in Bangalore (or any other city of your choice) by classifying accommodation for incoming students on the basis of their preferences on amenities, budget and proximity to the location.

Clustering is the task of grouping the elements such that observations of same group are more similar to each other than those in other group.

Affinity Propagation is a graph-based algorithm that assigns each observation to its nearest exemplar. Basically, all the observations “vote” for which other observations they want to be associated with, which results in a partitioning of the whole dataset into a large number of uneven clusters.

Geolocational Analysis is the analysis that processes Satellite images, GPS coordinates and Street addresses and apply to geographic models.
